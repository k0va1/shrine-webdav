# Shrine::Storage::WebDAV

Provides a simple WebDAV storage for Shrine.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/funbox/shrine-webdav.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/funbox/shrine-webdav)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'shrine-webdav'
```

## Usage

Suppose you have Report model which should be able to store data in a remote WebDAV storage.
```ruby
class Report < ApplicationRecord
end
# == Schema Information
#
# Table name: reports
#
#  id                :uuid             not null, primary key
#  name              :string           not null
#  created_at        :datetime         not null
#  updated_at        :datetime         not null
```
Before you can add attributes pointing to remote files to your model you should describe Uploader class:
```ruby
# app/models/reports/report_uploader.rb
class ReportUploader < Shrine
  plugin :activerecord
  plugin :logging, logger: Rails.logger

  def generate_location(_io, context)
    uuid = context[:record].id
    "#{uuid}.#{context[:name]}"
  end
end
```
You don't have to override method `generate_location`, but if you didn't you would have random file names.

Now you can add the attributes:
```ruby
class Report < ApplicationRecord
  include ReportUploader::Attachment.new(:pdf)
  include ReportUploader::Attachment.new(:xls)
end
```
Note corresponding migrations:
```ruby
class AddFileAttributes < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.1]
  def change
    add_column :reports, :xls_data, :text
    add_column :reports, :pdf_data, :text
  end
end
```

Create file `shrine.rb` in `config/initializers/` to configure WebDAV storage:
```ruby
# config/initializers/shrine.rb
require 'shrine'
require "shrine/storage/webdav"

# Add WebDAV credentials if you want to use basic auth
webdav_credentials = { user: ENV['WEBDAV_USER'], pass: ENV['WEBDAV_PASSWORD'] }

# If you don't want to use auth just remove `credentials` key
Shrine.storages = {
  cache: Shrine::Storage::WebDAV.new(host: 'http://webdav-server.com', prefix: 'your_project/cache', credentials: webdav_credentials),
  store: Shrine::Storage::WebDAV.new(host: 'http://webdav-server.com', prefix: 'your_project/store', credentials: webdav_credentials)
}
```

Now you can use your virtual attributes `pdf` and `xls` like this:
```ruby
report = Report.new(name: 'Senseless report')

# here you are going to have file sample.pdf uploaded
# to "http://webdav-server.com/your_project/cache/#{report.id}.pdf"
report.pdf = File.open('sample.pdf')

# file sample.xls is being uploading
# to "http://webdav-server.com/your_project/cache/#{report.id}.xls"
report.xls = File.open('sample.xls')

# after committing in database both files sample.pdf and sample.xls have
# been uploaded to "http://webdav-server.com/your_project/store/..."
report.save
```

## Development
